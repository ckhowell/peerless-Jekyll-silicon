## Unless I'm missing something here, the number of companies currently recruiting for a salesperson is enormous. 

We have a massive shortage of sales professionals, let alone ones that can successfully develop new business, promote new products and manage your best clients.

It's about time to make the call and seek help, as traditional methods just don't work anymore.

It's difficult to attract candidates even to apply, and salaries are increasing faster than you can afford or are willing to pay. We find most companies are still only hiring for a particular product segment experience.

> We've developed good, better and best options to suit all budgets to support you in hiring a quality sales professional. (and fast....)

- If you want to save money and have the time to spare, you can utilise our DIY option and keep it "in-house". (GOOD)
- If you're busy but can allocate someone within your team to do some of the work, we can work closely with you. (BETTER)
- You're flat out and are better off spending your valuable time managing your business. We can do it all for you. (BEST)

We also offer payment options over a 6,9, or 12-month period that is super easy to get started with.

All our recruitment comes with a 6-month guarantee if your successful candidate meets the criteria, and you'll be amazed at the candidates we recruited last year. (references and stats available at request, just ask)End of rant... maybe a little more, as we're passionate about helping you.

Come on, sales leaders, we weren't trained on attracting candidates in challenging markets and recruiting, so reach out for support instead of hiring someone you know isn't great for your role, and 50% more than likely will fail within 12 months, costing you $100k +. 🥴
