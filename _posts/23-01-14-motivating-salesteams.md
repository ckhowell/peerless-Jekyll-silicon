## As a leader, have you ever wondered why some salespeople chase incentives harder than others? 

It's a fact, and from my experience managing sales teams, that no matter how much you put on the table, some salespeople are not motivated to push to earn more money. The top 10% of salespeople are 47% more motivated than the bottom 10%, and these stats take over 2.2m+ salespeople.

Maybe they've been comfortable with their current customer base; their salary is enough to live on, and they're in a good spot financially.

That's great for any person, and I respect that, but as a business owner or sales leader, it won't work long-term if you want to increase sales or develop new product ranges when your team isn't motivated.

For business development, you want more "extrinsic" types of salespeople on your team. That's why sales roles vary dramatically, and someone with just "industry experience" won't do whatever it takes to succeed, and more so if they are "intrinsic".

We also provide insights into many sales-related motivational tendencies to help managers best motivate their salespeople, as sometimes management isn't updating incentives to support market conditions!

If you want to find out how your salespeople are motivated or develop ways to reward your team in ways that relate to them, please get in touch with Arrow for a confidential discussion.

We promise to clear up the questions you've been thinking about for years within 48 hours 🚀, instead of waiting another two years and tolerating non-performance.
