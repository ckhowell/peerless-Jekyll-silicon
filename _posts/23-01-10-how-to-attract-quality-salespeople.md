## There are at least three keyways on Google.

1. You could jump around in the hay until you get pricked by the needle. (Similar to hiring someone with industry experience, going on "gut feel" and hoping it doesn't hurt you too much. It will also take a lot of trial and error, which your clients won't appreciate!)

2. You could spread the hay out into a thin layer and then make several passes over it with a giant magnet. (This could take a while, and you might miss it if the hay is thick)

3. Or you could burn it all and then sift through the ashes. (Quicker process, but you'll lose your hay)



##### We prefer only to use the Objective Management Groups (OMG) sales assessments, save time and money and discover superstars that your competitors cannot. Ones that can sell more effectively and are motivated to create new opportunities.
